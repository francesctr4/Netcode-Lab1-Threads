# Network and Online Games - Lab 1: Multithreading in Unity

## Proposed Activity

Using multithreading in Unity, complete the following tasks:

- Implement an additional sorting algorithm (other than Bubble Sort) to compare performance between the two.
- Ensure that the sorting process runs on a separate thread so that the main Unity thread remains responsive and the frame rate is not interrupted during sorting.
